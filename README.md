#DAA 4th Sem
-This repository contains programs related to Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) for the 4th semester.
#Programs Included
1. Factorial using Iterative Method
-This program calculates the factorial of a given number using an iterative approach (loop-based method).
2. Factorial using Recursion
-This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion, where the function calls itself to compute the result.

#How to Run
1.Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DAA-4th-Sem.git
cd DAA-4th-Sem
2.Compile and run the Java files
javac FactorialIterative.java  
java FactorialIterative  
javac FactorialRecursive.java  
java FactorialRecursive  

#Example Output
Input: 5
Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
