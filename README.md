#DAA 4th Sem

-This repository contains programs related to Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) for the 4th semester.

#Programs Included

1. Factorial using Iterative Method
   
-This program calculates the factorial of a given number using an iterative approach (loop-based method).

3. Factorial using Recursion

-This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion, where the function calls itself to compute the result.

Input: 5

Output: Factorial of 5 is 120


3.Binary Search

-This is an implementation of the Binary Search Algorithm in java. Binary Search is an efficient searching technique used to find an element in a sorted array in O(log n) time complexity.

4.Linear Search 

-Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in an array until the target value is found or the end of the array is reached. It has a time complexity of O(n), making it efficient for small datasets but not ideal for large ones.

#How It Works

1.Start from the first element of the array.

2.Compare each element with the target value.

3.If a match is found, return the index of the element.

4.If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1 to indicate the element is not present.

5.Merge Sort

-This is a simple Java implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm â€” a classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

#Features

-Sorts an array of integers

-Uses recursion to divide the array

-Merges sorted halves efficiently

#Sample Output

Original array:
[38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]

Sorted array:
[3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]

6.Quick sort

-This program implements the Quick Sort algorithm using an array. Quick Sort is a popular and efficient sorting technique that follows the divide and conquer strategy.

#Key Features

-Fast average-case time complexity: O(n log n).

-In-place sorting (no extra array needed).

-Efficient for large datasets.

#How Quick Sort Works

1.Choose a pivot element (commonly the last element or a random element).

2.Partition the array so that:

  -All elements less than the pivot come before it.

  -All elements greater come after it.

3.Recursively apply the same process to the left and right partitions.
