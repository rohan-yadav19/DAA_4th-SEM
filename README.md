#DAA 4th Sem

-This repository contains programs related to Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) for the 4th semester.

#Programs Included

1. Factorial using Iterative Method
   
-This program calculates the factorial of a given number using an iterative approach (loop-based method).

3. Factorial using Recursion

-This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion, where the function calls itself to compute the result.

Input: 5

Output: Factorial of 5 is 120


3.Binary Search

-This is an implementation of the Binary Search Algorithm in java. Binary Search is an efficient searching technique used to find an element in a sorted array in O(log n) time complexity.

4.Linear Search 

-Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in an array until the target value is found or the end of the array is reached. It has a time complexity of O(n), making it efficient for small datasets but not ideal for large ones.

#How It Works

1.Start from the first element of the array.

2.Compare each element with the target value.

3.If a match is found, return the index of the element.

4.If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1 to indicate the element is not present.



#How to Run

1.Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/DAA-4th-Sem.git
cd DAA-4th-Sem

2.Compile and run the Java files

javac FactorialIterative.java  
java FactorialIterative  
javac FactorialRecursive.java  
java FactorialRecursive  

#Example Output

Input: 5

Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
